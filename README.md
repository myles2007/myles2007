<h3 align=center> Hobbies</h3>
If I'm not at my computer working on a personal project, you'll likely
find me outdoors somewhere either taking photos, running, biking, hiking, or
some combination of those things.
<br/><br/>
Staying fit and pushing my physical limits is as important to
me as growing mentally which is why I set annual fitness goals.
<br/><br/>
Here's how I'm doing this year:
